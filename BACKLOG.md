# WebAPI Core Mandelbrot - Development Backlog

## 🎯 High Priority Issues

### ✅ Canvas Size Optimization (COMPLETED)
**Issue**: Frontend canvas changes size dynamically based on browser window size, causing inconsistent Mandelbrot visualization quality.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
- ✅ Changed canvas from 4K (3840×2160) to optimal 1024×768 (4:3 ratio)
- ✅ Removed responsive CSS sizing, implemented fixed canvas dimensions  
- ✅ Added proper viewport centering with horizontal scroll for small screens
- ✅ Fixed legend positioning to stay beside canvas
- ✅ Updated SharedConstants and regenerated TypeScript constants

**RESULTS ACHIEVED**:
- ✅ Consistent visualization quality across all devices
- ✅ ~10x performance improvement (8.3M→786K pixels)
- ✅ Predictable GPU memory usage
- ✅ Proper side-by-side legend layout maintained
- ✅ Optimal mathematical precision for Mandelbrot set

**Status**: RESOLVED - Canvas now uses fixed 1024×768 dimensions for consistent quality and performance
