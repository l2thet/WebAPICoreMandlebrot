# WebAPI Core Mandelbrot - Development Backlog

## 🎯 High Priority Issues

### 📐 Canvas Size Optimization (Critical)
**Issue**: Frontend canvas changes size dynamically based on browser window size, causing inconsistent Mandelbrot visualization quality.

**Problem Details**:
- Canvas dimensions affect computation grid resolution
- Different screen sizes = different iteration density
- Optimal Mandelbrot visualization requires consistent aspect ratio
- Current responsive behavior compromises mathematical accuracy
- GPU memory allocation changes with canvas size

**Proposed Solution**:
- Set static canvas dimensions optimized for Mandelbrot set visualization
- Recommended: 800x600 or 1024x768 (4:3 ratio) for classic MB proportions
- Alternative: 1200x800 (3:2 ratio) for widescreen compatibility
- Make canvas non-responsive to browser window changes
- Add CSS to center and maintain fixed size regardless of viewport

**Technical Implementation**:
1. Update `SharedConstants.cs`:
   ```csharp
   public const int OptimalCanvasWidth = 1024;
   public const int OptimalCanvasHeight = 768;
   ```
2. Remove responsive CSS from canvas styling
3. Update frontend to use fixed dimensions
4. Add viewport centering and scrolling if needed
5. Update GPU buffer allocation to use fixed size

**Benefits**:
- Consistent visualization quality across devices
- Predictable GPU memory usage
- Optimal mathematical precision
- Better performance (no dynamic resizing)
